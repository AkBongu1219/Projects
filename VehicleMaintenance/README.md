# Vehicle Maintenance Predictor

### Deep Learing Project
Created an Artificial Neural Network from scratch that predicts whether a vehicle needs maintenance depending on factors like model, last service data, mileage etc. Used Tenserflow and Keras for constructing the Neural Network. Used HTML, CSS and JS for frontend. Hosted backend on flask.
